	Software is becoming more and more aware of its current execution context. Decisions traditionally made at design time are moved at run-time to enhance the services offered by the software to its users. Furthermore, software reasons about the execution environments and its internal status to enhance the functionality provided by its users. Some of the keywords that characterize the software today are: context-aware, dynamic, autonomous, smart, adaptive, self-managed. 
	</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>
	In this context, the Context-aware, Autonomous, and Smart Architectures (CASA) workshop aims to address the issues and challenges raised by the design, implementation, and evaluation of software systems characterized by the above-mentioned keywords. Novel design and development approaches are needed to face the new issues raised by such systems. New solutions are expected to address properly the trade-offs among the various quality attributes characterizing these systems. Or, existing architectural solutions should be adapted and improved to meet the evolving and dynamic requirements of context-aware, autonomous, and smart systems. 
	</p>
	<p>
	The workshop aims to bring together software engineers and computer scientists, researchers, practitioners and educators to discuss and exchanges results, case studies, experiences,  novel approaches and visionary ideas concerning software architectures for context-aware, autonomous, and smart solutions.

<article> <h1 id="topics">Topics</h1>
<p> The CASA 2017 workshop is interested in all the topics concerning the
architectural aspects in Context-aware, Autonomous, and Smart
(CASA) solutions. Please find below several examples of possible
topics:
<ul>
<li> software architectures for CASA solutions: surveys, issues,
challenges, comparisons;
<li> architecture frameworks for CASA solutions;
<li> architecture description languages for CASA solutions;
<li> standards for software architectures in CASA solutions;
<li> model-driven engineering for CASA solutions;
<li> software architecture and Big Data for CASA solutions;
<li> software architecture and Internet-of-Things for CASA
solutions;
<li> cloud-computing and network infrastructures for CASA
solutions;
<li> machine learning and CASA solutions;
<li> autonomous and self-adaptive aspects of CASA solutions;
<li> social and technological issues in CASA solutions;
<li> evolution and maintenance issues in CASA solutions;
<li> privacy, safety, security, cyber-physical issues in CASA
solutions;
<li> testing and evaluation of smartness in CASA solutions;
<li> software architectures in CASA case studies and innovative
applications;
<li> teaching software architectures for CASA solutions.

		<article>
			<h1 id="submission">Submission Guidelines</h1>
		  	<p> The workshop invites two types of submissions:
				<ul>
					<li> full research and experience papers, presenting novel
contributions concerning the architectural aspects of contextaware,
autonomous, and smart solutions;
<li> short and position papers, presenting promising preliminary
results from work-in-progress or research challenges in software
architectures for context-aware, autonomous, and smart solutions.
			</ul>
<p> All the papers must be written in English and respect the ECSA
2017 guidelines and length rules.
<p> Submitted papers will be reviewed by at least 3 members of
Program/Organizing Committee (or their sub-reviewers) and
selection of accepted papers will be based on relevance, quality
and originality of the submitted papers. For each accepted paper,
at least one of the (co)author(s) is expected to be present at the
workshop and to present the paper.	
	<p> All the submitted papers should follow the ACM ICPS proceedings templates 
		available at: <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/article-templates/proceedings-template.html/"> ACM web site </a>.
		</article>
		
		<article>
			<h1 id="publication">Publication </h1>
			<p> All the accepted papers will be published in the ECSA2017 Companion by ACM ICPS. 
			<p> We plan to invite the accepted papers to a <b>special issue</b> on the
topics of the workshop in a journal. More information will be soon provided.
